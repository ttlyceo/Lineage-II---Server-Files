name = Closest Town
Handles the options to where to spawn when dead
each member can have multiple locations
but requires the 3 member to exist! (SpawnLocations, BufferLocations and GKLocations)
DEFAULT is used when a "closest city" is not created here!

if the bot dies, he will see if the nearest city is inside this list.
If so, it will take the routes from it.
	Sequentialy, he will first spawn in one of the random SpawnLocations
	Then he will "simulate" rebuff going to a BufferLocations location
	and next he will go to the GK location GKLocations
	Keep in mind that this can bug if no direct view between locations
