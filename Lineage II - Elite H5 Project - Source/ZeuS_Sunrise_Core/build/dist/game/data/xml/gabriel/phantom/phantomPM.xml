<!--How to use
    It is self explanatory
    searchMethod possibilities: EQUALS, STARTS_WITH, CONTAINS, DEFAULT
    always put DEFAULT as last and only use ONE. This will be used when none of the above is found

    It will see if it is EQUAL, or look for a text that STARTS_WITH, or CONTAINS (This will look if contains all of the possible words given) the "searchText".
    It will occur in this order EQUALS->STARTS_WITH->CONTAINS
    and if none is found, the chosen answer bill be used from DEFAULT.

    Answers are random

    searchText and answers are splitted by ";" in case of multiple
