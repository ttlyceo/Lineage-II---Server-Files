<!-- This is the "auto farm" feature (still in tests) 
In theory, if you spawn a character inside the Area Center location, he will "try" to farm inside that area from the Min till Max Level
if he reaches max level, he will try to go to another farm zone if it exists here

as example below.

when spawning a fake, it will automaticaly come and try to farm / levelup in these areas

so spawn a random lv 1 or citizen and it will stay there, random will attack mobs, citizen will just stay
if click on button for fake spawn, they will run to these locations here and level up
check these locations if u want
